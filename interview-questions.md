# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: At LEARN we use git repositories to simulate the work-flow environment of a developer. Git is a system that allows you to keep track and manage your ongoing projects. GitHub is the service that hosts the git repositories that you are managing.

Researched answer:  Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Operators that check for a relationship between two values will return a Boolean value of true or false.

Researched answer: Logical and Relational operators will return a Boolean value. Examples of logical operators: &&(Logical AND), ||(Logical OR ), !(Logical NOT)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: A value would be the data type present inside of the array element. An index would be the location of the value inside the array. Indexes are sequential numbers starting with 0 and operate like an address for each element inside the array

Researched answer:

4. What is iteration? 

Your answer: An iteration could be described as setting parameters and actions until a certain condition is met.

Researched answer: Iterations are used to perform specific tasks, solve problems and present solutions. "For loop" is an example of an iteration that creates a loop that executes as long as the condition is true

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming technique is a collabortive way to complete a project or work on a code. There is a navigator that is responsible for articulating code and parameters. Also, there is a driver whose responsibility is to receive the code and ensure it is typed in correctly. The driver shares their screen so both parties can work and see the project.

Researched answer: Pair programing is a software development technique when two programmers work together at one station. There is a driver that writes the code while the other known as a navigator reviews the code as it is typed in.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function accepts parameters and returns a function

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework meant to test your javascript code

3. Objects: Objects are variables that can contain many values.

4. Method: Javascript methos are actions that can be performed on objects

5. Classes: Class is a program code template used for creating objects, initiating values and implimenting behavior
